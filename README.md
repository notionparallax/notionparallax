### Hi there 👋, I'm Ben Doherty ![](https://pronoun.cyou/x/y?subject=He&object=Him&posessive=His&posessive-pronoun=His&reflexive=Himself&emoji=%F0%9F%91%AB&colour=B00B55&height=20&sep=%20|%20&flag=straightally)

- I’m currently working on:
    - [Walden Pond](https://waldenpond.press/), a personalised magazine. ([:octocat: front end](https://github.com/notionparallax/wp2frontEnd), back end is full of secrets 🧙‍♂️)
    - [Design Computing](http://design-computing.github.io/) A UNSW course in the Computational Design degree that teaches how to use Python to do useful things, and how to explore public data and tell stories with it. ([:octocat: profile:](https://github.com/design-computing))
    - Pronoun badge ([:octocat:](https://github.com/notionparallax/pronoun-badge)) a way for you to add pronouns to your GitHub readme (see above for an example!). There's an interface for generating the url [here](https://peaceful-goodall-c192fb.netlify.app/).

I also have a website at [notionparallax.co.uk](http://notionparallax.co.uk/) 🐷

And a much neglected meetup: [
Sydney computational design group](https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-computational-design-group/)

I tweet a bit from [@notionparallax](https://twitter.com/notionparallax) and [@WaldenPondZine](https://twitter.com/WaldenPondZine)
